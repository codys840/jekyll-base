<h1>Begin the morning...</h1>
...by saying to yourself,
<br>  I shall meet with the busybody,
<br>  the ungrateful, arrogant, deceitful, envious, unsocial.
<br>  All these things happen to them
<br>  by reason of their ignorance
<br>  of what is good and evil.
<br>  But I, who have seen the nature of the good that it is beautiful,
<br>  and of the bad that it is ugly,
<br>  and the nature of him who does wrong,
<br>  that it is akin to me,
<br>  not only of the same blood or seed,
<br>  but that it participates in the same intelligence
<br>  and the same portion of the divinity,
<br>  I can neither be injured by any of them,
<br>  for no one can fix on me what is ugly,
<br>  nor can I be angry with my kinsman,
<br>  nor hate him.
<br>  For we are made for cooperation,
<br>  like feet, like hands, like eyelids,
<br>  like the rows of the upper and lower teeth.
<br>  To act against one another then is contrary to nature;
<br>  and it is acting against one another to be vexed and to turn away.
<br>    - Meditations 2:1

    <h1> The only thing that matters...</h1>

...is just a math problem with a rational, closed-form solution.
