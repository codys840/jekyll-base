    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    Begin the morning by saying to yourself,
    I shall meet with the busybody,
    the ungrateful, arrogant, deceitful, envious, unsocial.
    All these things happen to them
    by reason of their ignorance
    of what is good and evil.
    But I, who have seen the nature of the good that it is beautiful,
    and of the bad that it is ugly,
    and the nature of him who does wrong,
    that it is akin to me,
    not only of the same blood or seed,
    but that it participates in the same intelligence
    and the same portion of the divinity,
    I can neither be injured by any of them,
    for no one can fix on me what is ugly,
    nor can I be angry with my kinsman,
    nor hate him.
    For we are made for cooperation,
    like feet, like hands, like eyelids,
    like the rows of the upper and lower teeth.
    To act against one another then is contrary to nature;
    and it is acting against one another to be vexed and to turn away.
